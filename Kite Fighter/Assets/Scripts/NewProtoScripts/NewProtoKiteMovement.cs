    // Create a ball or whatever that is 'attached' to the quater surface of the sphere.
    // Make it so that it 'airspeed' (the speed at which it moves) is a funtion of the 'iso lines' no matater it's direction.

    // V apparent = [1/(L/D)][(L/D)squared + 1/2]Wcos(<PFK). L/D is constant in ideal conditions, so constant. W, wind is too.
    // So the apparent speed is just a funtion of PFK in ideal conditions.

    //Then, the groundspeed, which I think I'll be using as the defacto speed, needs to combine two axises.
    // basically, when PFK is changing or not.
    // when PFK is not changing, it's the square of (VAsqrd - Wsqrd). Which it interesting cause if PFK isn't changing Va Isn't either.
    // DON'T FORGET THAT IT DOES SCALE WITH PRK CHANGING THOUGH.

    // However, Vg-pg = (L/D)Wcos(<PFK) } Wsin(<PFK)
    // when the kite is flying along any power-gradient line when crossing <PFK's iso-power line. So when PFK is changing?
    // The term }Wsin(<PFK) is positive when the kite is flying toward the powerzone,
    // and is negative when the kite is flying away from the powerzone.



    // First steps, constrain something to that quater sphere, and get the and PFK.
    // Make it so it can move along that constrained area.
